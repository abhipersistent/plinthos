package org.plinthos.core.queue;

/**
 * A queue is a container that stores a list of items. Items can be inserted and
 * removed from the queue based on the <b> Priority Weighted Queue Algorithm <b>
 * Each time while taking the item in the queue, the priority weighting queue
 * algorithm will exceuted and based on the weight , the items will be
 * processed. <b> <center> Priority Weighted Queue Algorithm <br/> Babis
 * Marmanis </center></b>
 * 
 * When a job \uFB01nishes,and the worker responds that is ready to receive a
 * new request,we go in the queue and select a new request as follows:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li> We evaluate the T l for each request if T l <0 then we subtract the re-
 * quest from the queue according to whatever business logic is desirable.
 * <li> We evaluate the weight w i for the i-th request as the sum of three
 * contributions:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The priority contribution given as \u03B1p i
 * <li> The time to live contribution given as \u03B2 (T l )i
 * <li> The size contribution given as \u03B3 (S b )i
 * </ul>
 * the coe\uFB03cients \u03B1 ,\u03B2 ,and \u03B3 should be con \uFB01gurable
 * and accessible on real-time.These coe \uFB03cients will be manipulated by the
 * system as well.
 * <li> Based on the weight we order the requests in the queue and select the
 * request with the highest weight.
 * <li>We reevaluate \u03BB and ï¿½based on the new data and solve for a phase
 * space that is ten times larger in dof than the current state cardinality. If
 * the probability to be in the same state is larger than the value that is
 * determined in a con \uFB01gurable state weight list then we will make \u03B3
 * negative,in which case the smaller the job the higher its weight. We can also
 * increase the priority of small size requests based on weighted or uniform
 * distribution.Typically the simulation should run for as long as E [s ].
